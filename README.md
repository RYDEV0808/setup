# setup
This python package provides tools helpful for beginners in python, it helps make the code read-able and easily managed.


# Notes:
* to use, add the init file in a folder, then in python, "import "FolderName"
* do not rename the init file as it will lead to an error
* the class functions: "MissingColorama()", and "MissingPygame()" from the "ask" class only works with Windows

# Update logs & information:
* V1.5 -- checks the system type in class ask, if being used
* V1.6 -- installing with ask, now made more readable with the auto-install function, which also specifys the reason the install might not be working
* no current work in progress...
